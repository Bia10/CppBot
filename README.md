# CppBot

World of Warcraft (wow) 3.3.5 (WOTLK) bot for learning purposes written in c++
I'm doing this while i learn c++ in the same time and in fact this is my first c++ program.
I will appreciate any advices and questions, feel free to participate in any time and thank you if you do.

In order to be compiled, the solution needs to be set as x86 platform from the configuration manager.
